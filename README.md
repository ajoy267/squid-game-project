# Alchemy Squid Games 
* Andrew Joy, Indy Holdsworth, Phoenix Nicholson, Kevin Do
* Description: You are in debt because of your tuition to Alchemy Code Lab. You're desperate to pay it off so you sign up.. for the squid game.. 
* Problem Domain: This project will serve as an immersion for the user to feel like they are in the squid games (without the dying part)
* We will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project
* Miro Board: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lm95oS4=/
* Conflicts and Communications Plan: 
    ## Conflict Plan
    * What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
        * Group discussion, hear out both sides of conflict. You are not your code, don’t take things personally. Group decides on best approach.

    * How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
        * A group discussion. Noticed a lack of work. Ask them why, if they need help, if they’re struggling with something. 

    * What is your process to resolve conflicts?
	    * Group discussion.

    * How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
        * Third time bringing up the same issue, call in JULIE.

    ## Communication Plan
    * How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
        * Use our slack group chat. Answer slack until 10:00pm.
    * What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
        * Include people in the conversation, bring them in if silent or ask why. Don’t take offense if you quiet
    * How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
        * Be inclusive and friendly, accept other people’s ideas
