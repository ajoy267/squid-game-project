# Alchemy Squid Game Grading Notes
_be sure to check the PR for specific code comments_
## General Comments
* This is really great -- your code is really clean and easy to read -- I have a few comments where you could DRY things up a little but overall, you should be really proud of this project
* The odd/even game has some logic flaws -- take a look at the changes I made and let me know if you have questions
